Welcome to my little Notes program. I wrote it to display notes stored in Nextcloud on the desktop. If the nextcloud memory is synchronized with the local hard disk, it also contains the .md files of the notes. These are usually saved in the / Nextcloud / Notes / folder. My program creates a separate note for each file, which can also be edited in the note window and is also saved automatically. If the position and size of the window is changed, this is saved in a JSON file in the Pos folder. When the note in the nextcloud, for example from the handy, is deleted. the note window on the desktop and the associated JSON file are also automatically deleted. The terminal / bash is hidden by a space and a "&" behind the path to be executed. This can also be seen in the link file, which can be inserted in /home/.config/Autostart. Of course, the path in this file, as well as the path to the notifier of the nextcloud, in the python file, must be adjusted.
